We want to extract the dates from the following texts, the dates can be like "09/13/2021" or "09-13-2021", 
but not "09-13/2021" or "09/13/2021".

For example: 

```
input str200 address 
"War of 1812 Peace Treaty was signed on 12/24/1814"
"World's first movie theater opened in Paris on 12/25-1776"
"Texas A&M University went coed on 04/27/1963"
"The most recent leap second was added on 12-31/2016"
end
```


The trick to accomplish this is to capture the match of the first separator **\[/-\]** into a group **(..)**, 
then referencing it using **\#** (where **#** is the index of the group) to match the second occurrence.   

```   
. gen date = ustrregexs(0) if ustrregexm(history, "\d{2}([/-])\d{2}\1\d{4}")
(2 missing values generated)

. 
. list

  1. |         War of 1812 Peace Treaty was signed on 12/24/1814   12/24/1814 |
  2. | World's first movie theater opened in Paris on 12/25-1776              |
  3. |              Texas A&M University went coed on 04/27/1963   04/27/1963 |
  4. |       The most recent leap second was added on 12-31/2016              |
